# Shipping a big change without breaking something

Every bug we have shipped in this codebase has been the same shape: **two
places that had to agree, and nothing checking that they did.** None of them
were type errors. The code compiled perfectly while the staff screen said a
table owed MX$105 and the diner's screen said it owed nothing.

So this is not a style guide. It is the list of things that have actually bitten
us, and what now catches each one.

## What runs on its own

`src/lib/__tests__/invariants.spec.ts` enforces the rules that span files:

| Rule | The bug it came from |
|---|---|
| A table created after the blanket `revoke … from anon` locks itself down | `rate_limits` shipped world-readable |
| No dialog is rendered inside another dialog | Shipped three times — two focus traps, two Escapes to leave |
| Anything marking an order paid or written off closes the sitting | A sitting that never closes holds the table and the diner forever |
| Every API route has a guard or a rate limit | `order-status` was public and unlimited from the day it was written |

`src/lib/__tests__/schema-drop.spec.ts` keeps `drop.sql` in step with
`schema.sql` — every table, every function, every storage policy. Eight tables
had drifted, which is why `db:reset` failed on production.

`src/lib/__tests__/i18n-parity.spec.ts` keeps both catalogues complete.

`pnpm smoke` signs in for real and loads **every** dashboard page plus a
customer menu, failing on an error boundary, a bounce to login, or a page with
no content. `pnpm smoke:prod` does the same against the deployed site. Written
after three separate "it works" claims that were each checked one page at a
time while a neighbouring page was blank.

`pnpm prod:check` compares dev and production schemas, loads a real customer
menu, and confirms every documented login resolves to a restaurant **in both
environments**. Run it after every merge.

## What still needs a person

These have all cost us a round trip. None are automatable yet.

**A long-lived dev server lies.** After dozens of merges it will serve a stale
compile of one page beside a fresh build of another — a page that sends the old
set of props to a component that now requires new ones, which throws at
hydration and white-screens. It looks exactly like a code bug and is not one.
If a page breaks and the source looks right, `rm -rf .next` and restart before
debugging anything. `pnpm smoke` against a freshly started server is the only
verification that means anything.

**Look at it. In a browser. Actually rendered.**
Measuring is not looking. The menus dropdown reported a sensible rectangle from
`getBoundingClientRect` and was never once painted — an `overflow-x` ancestor
was clipping it. It shipped, and the only reason we found out is that somebody
hovered it. When a screenshot cannot be captured, `document.elementFromPoint`
at the element's own centre tells you whether it is really on screen.

**When a rule applies to money, apply it to every path or none.**
The bill window went onto the diner's read and the staff read, but the staff
screens kept their own unwindowed query — three contradictions from one change.
Before shipping a rule about what a bill contains, list every route that reads
or writes orders and say out loud which side of the rule each one is on.

**Both databases, every time.**
Dev is not a scratch pad. Resetting dev and re-seeding only production left
`demo@tabletap.dev` with no restaurant, and the next person to sign in lost a
morning to a bug that was not in the code. `pnpm prod:check` now covers both.

**Ask what the key is keyed by.**
The tracker offered a diner the order they had placed at a different table,
because the memory was keyed per restaurant when the thing it described was per
table. When storing state about "the current X", write down what makes one X
different from the next.

**A schema only counts if it builds from empty.**
`schema.sql` could not, for months: storage policies called `has_role()` a
hundred lines before it was created, and it only ever worked because a reset
left the old function behind. `pnpm db:reset` on dev is the only thing that
proves it.

**A guard that redirects still answers 200.**
Next's `redirect()` from a server component replies to a document request with
the *target's* HTML and no `Location` header. A checker written on
`status === 200` reported 17 permission holes that did not exist. Probe a page
by a marker string only that page prints — never a nav label, which every page
carries. That is what `pnpm roles` does.

**Reaching a page is not seeing all of it.**
A manager opens Ajustes but must not see Zona horaria or Pagos; a waiter opens
Cuentas abiertas but must not see the activity log. When a module moves between
screens it inherits the audience of the new screen, and nothing in the types
says so. Assert the sections, not just the routes.

**A grid turns every child into a cell, headings included.**
"Mesas por cobrar" and "Otras cuentas abiertas" were `<p>`s inside a
three-column grid, so each took one cell and the cards flowed around them —
tables appeared under the wrong title, and a table that had not asked to pay
read as waiting. A heading inside a grid needs `grid-column: 1 / -1`.

**`min-width: 0` on the only elastic column is how text ends up under a badge.**
The bill row's name collapsed to zero width the moment a table carried a badge:
the text overflowed and the amount owed sat behind the Cobrar button — on a
phone, which is the waiter's screen. Give the elastic child a real minimum and
let the row wrap instead. Then grow the skeleton by the same line
(`bills/loading.tsx`), or the list jumps when it loads.

**A checker that filters out the broken case will always pass.**
The first version of the layout audit skipped every element with
`width === 0` as "not visible" — which is precisely the shape of the bug it
was written to catch, so it went green on a cart whose dish name was squashed
to nothing. It also measured `scrollWidth`, which is always 0 on an inline
element like the `<strong>` holding every dish name. **Prove a new guard by
breaking the thing on purpose and watching it fail.**

**Text can be unreadable while every test passes.**
The cart line that a customer sees before paying spent a release with the dish
name at 38px on a phone — one word per line, the promo badge painted over the
struck price, the amount hidden behind the button. Nothing failed. `pnpm layout`
is what now catches this: every screen, phone and desktop, checked for text
squashed to nothing, text over text, and the page running off the side.

## Before merging anything large

1. `npx tsc --noEmit && pnpm lint && pnpm test`
2. `pnpm smoke` — every page still renders for a signed-in user
2b. `pnpm layout` — every page can still be *read*, at 390px and 1280px
3. `pnpm db:reset` on dev — proves the schema still builds from nothing
4. Open the thing you changed in a browser, at 1280px and at 390px, in Spanish
5. If it is money, name every route that touches it and check each one
6. If it changes what we collect, charge, or promise — update the legal text and
   regenerate the PDFs (`node scripts/legal-pdf.mjs`)
7. `pnpm prod:check` and `pnpm smoke:prod` after the merge

## When you find the next one

Add a test to `invariants.spec.ts` and a row to the table above. The list is
only useful because everything on it is something that really happened.
